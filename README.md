# Lucy
A text based RPG Game.

First game project for last year of upper secondary school, subject: Adaptive programming

The task is set to, get a basic knowledge of C++ and create a simple text based game of our own.
This game was set to be a mini-rpg where you kill some random enemies.

NOTE:
This was the first C++ project I ever did.
